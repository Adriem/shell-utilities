Adriem's Shell Utilities
========================

This project contains some utilities and snippets that I found useful and want
to remember in the future. The snippets are written in *snippets.md*, while the
scripts are written in its own files. If a script needs more than one file, they
will be stored into a folder. The scripts are self-documented, so take a look
at them if you want to know what they do :).

Notice
----------

I have test all these snippets and scripts in my machines, but keep in mind that
while they work on them, they may not work in yours. If something is not working
on your computer, please let me know opening an issue. I don't promise I will
find a solution, but at least I will add an advice in order to make it useful
for other people.
